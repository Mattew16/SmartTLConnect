* The specifications document is already started, using the example that Afonso gave me.
* We are waiting for the reply from a meeting to discuss the modem.
* After the call monday we know that the serial board is compatible with both the modem (has a serial connection) and the APN network (only the modem needs to support it).
* The testing server will be ready on the 19th (as per Daniel's information).
*  We need to ask for a quotation for the APN network:
	*  1GB/month per SIM card;
	*  Speed isnt relevant.
* VM needs to find a way for to enable the board to do hard resets of the modem (probably by being the modem's power source).
* About XEO there is nothing new this week. But I'm also helping them with their website.
