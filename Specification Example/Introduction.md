Sitraffic smartGuard is a system that allows full access to the new Sitraffic sX traffic controller with convinient functions for ease of handling and overview as well as a graphical user interface that help the user to easily locate the required information. 

Older controllers cannot connect with this system because they lack a communication protocol necessary for the connection to exist. We are developing a solution of hardware and software that would allow these controllers to be represented in smartguard, though with less funcionality.

This document describes the hardware and software adaptations required on both systems to be able to communicate with each other.
