#Notes about the APN 28/09/2015
* The board can be simple, if the modem can understand the RS232 protocol. 
* The APN depends on the modem only, which the modem can support. 
* Initialize on the start, using commands AP (on the manual).
* Works similar to SMS's, receiving and sending with simple commands.
* Watchdog for the modem, able to reset, hard reboot.
* Private/Public APN makes no difference. Its a configuration setting.
